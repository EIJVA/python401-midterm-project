In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?
Hoping to get better at my technical skills for this part of the course think that will help me improving my coding skills
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
Think we should start with a standup at the start of each day where folks will go over what they worked on yesterday and chat about what tasks need to get done for the current day.

Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?
We should start by having at least two meetings per work day: the first meeting held should be to discuss plan for the day ahead of us, the second meeting to summarize the work completed.

## Conflict Plan
What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
No need to yell when trying to get your point across. Take the time to hear both sides and see if you can get to a mutual agreement. Try a group vote method if needed. If nothing else works, then pull in a Roger. We hope to bring any conflicts to the front and discuss the issues and see if we can try and bring both sides 
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
If you are feeling an issue, bring it up with the team. We hope to bring everyone along with us for this awesome ride.
How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We hope to try and get that person as caught up as we can but also not implement any code that everyone doesn’t understand. 
How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
Don’t address the issue directly first discuss with another team member's opinion on what they think and if that doesn’t work then we bring it up as a team. 
How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
Escalate when we can’t come to an agreement as a team.
