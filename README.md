## Alex

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team**

- I’m good at debugging and generally good at anything involving public speaking.  
- Enjoy working with front-end and back-end
- Generally enjoy getting to looking for bugs in already written code
**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**  
- I’m always down to do some peer coding so that everyone can get a better understanding of what’s going on!
- I’m also happy to do any of the presentation stuff.

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- Hoping to get better at my technical skills for this part of the course think that will help me improving my coding skills.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?  
- Think we should start with a standup at the start of each day where folks will go over what they worked on yesterday and chat about what tasks need to get done for the current day.  

## Eddie

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**  

- I enjoy working with API's on the back end and love rendering parsed data into front end code!
- Enjoy working on UI / UE tasks.
- Flexible, adaptible, and dependable

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

- I can help troubleshoot API issues and also help with the design-layout of the application.
- I can create an easy-to-use CLI for the majority of users
- If we run into obstacles, I can help come up with a alternative solution.

 **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**  

- Hoping to get better at my technical skills, specifically data strctures and algorithms.

**Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**  

- We should start by having at least two meetings per work day: the first meeting held should be to discuss plan for the day ahead of us, the second meeting to summarize the work completed.

- We should also ensure that were spread loading tasks, evenly. Git contribution should indicate participation by every group member.

## Victor

**What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

- I enjoy debugging and thinking outside the box to fix programming issues.  
- Flexibility is key and one of my strengths.

**How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

- Being flexible allows for the rapid movement from one task to another when needed.  
- Oftentimes when trying to fix errors in code it takes a fresh set of eyes that may notice a problem or work around that has not been thought of yet.

**In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

- I need to improve on my technical proficiencies.
- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?  
- Being open to ideas and flexible is important.  Also pair programming with others that may not be working on your specific area will help to better understand the overall project.

## Conflict Plan

**What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

- No need to yell when trying to get your point across. Take the time to hear both sides and see if you can get to a mutual agreement.

- We hope to try and get that person as caught up as we can but also not implement any code that everyone doesn’t understand.
  
**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

- Don’t address the issue directly first discuss with another team member's opinion on what they think and if that doesn’t work then we bring it up as a team.
